🖼️ WebP ➜ JPG Converter – Effortless CLI Tool with Drag & Drop Magic

A lightweight and cross-platform command-line tool written in **pure Go** for converting `.webp` images to `.jpg`. Built to simplify workflows where `.webp` is unsupported (e.g., Microsoft Office tools like Excel, Word, PowerPoint).

Just **drag & drop files onto the executable**, and it will output converted `.jpg` images to the **same folder**.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔄 Converts `.webp` to `.jpg` with a single drag-drop
- 🧼 No dependencies – just a single statically compiled Go binary
- 🌐 Cross-platform: works on Windows, macOS, Linux
- 🪄 Perfect for quick image fixes before document embedding
- 🚀 Fast & efficient — ideal for bulk conversions

## 🔧 Usage

Example usage from CLI
```bash
webp2jpg ./image1.webp ./photo2.webp
```

Or simply drag your `.webp` files onto the `webp2jpg` executable — converted `.jpg`s will appear next to the originals.
